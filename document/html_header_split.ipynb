(Rawls 1971: 49)  \\nThis requires that we reflect on a wide range of principles,\\narguments, and theories. Equilibrium is reached where principles and\\njudgments have been revised such that they agree with each other. In\\nshort, the method of reflective equilibrium is the mutual adjustment\\nof principles and judgments in the light of relevant argument and\\ntheory.  \\nReflective equilibrium is the dominant method in moral and political\\nphilosophy (McPherson 2015: 652; Anderson 2015; de Maagt 2017: 444).\\nIts advocates suggest that “it is the only rational game in town\\nfor the moral theorist” or “the only defensible\\nmethod” (DePaul 1993: 6; Scanlon 2003: 149; see also Freeman\\n2007: 35–36; Floyd 2017: 377–378). Though often endorsed,\\nit is far more frequently used. Wherever a philosopher presents\\nprinciples, motivated by arguments and examples, they are likely to be\\nusing the method. They are adjusting their principles—and with\\nluck, their readers’—to the judgments suggested by the\\narguments and examples. Alternatively they might “bite the\\nbullet” by adjusting initially discordant judgments to\\naccommodate otherwise appealing principles. Either way, they are\\nusually describing a process of reflective equilibrium, with\\nprinciples adjusted to judgments or vice versa. Reflective equilibrium\\nis a formal expression of standard methodological practice in moral\\nand political philosophy. (See Rawls 1971, e.g., 19–21, for a\\nfamous application of reflective equilibrium, and Rechnitzer 2022 for\\na reconstruction of Thomson 2008 in terms of reflective\\nequilibrium.)  \\nThis entry first addresses the judgments that are the starting point\\nfor reflective equilibrium, examining various interpretations of them\\nfound in the literature. It then explores the principles and theories\\nthat take us from merely having judgments to reaching reflective\\nequilibrium. Finally, it considers some of the main objections to the\\nmethod. Throughout the focus will be on reflective equilibrium in its\\narchetypal setting of moral and political philosophy, especially as it\\nhas been developed by Rawls and Norman Daniels, though with some\\nreference to versions of the method developed in other branches of\\nphilosophy (e.g., Goodman 1965; Lewis 1983; Elgin 1996).  \\nEntry Contents \\n \\n Entry Contents  \\n1.

On this\\nview, “independently motivated, initially tenable commitments\\nmust underwrite coherence,” for however coherent the components\\nof reflective equilibrium may be, “their mutual support may\\nderive from a judicious disregard for contravening\\nconsiderations” (Elgin 1996: 107; see also Baumberger & Brun\\n2021). Initial judgments anchor reflective equilibrium to something\\noutside itself. A similar suggestion is that inchoate initial\\njudgments are “a central constraint” (Schroeter 2004:\\n122).  \\nAn opposing view gives initial judgments no priority over subsequent\\njudgments. Moral beliefs may be formed that are not just different\\nfrom but discontinuous with one’s initial beliefs, which may be\\nrejected. One may, for instance, undergo a moral conversion, becoming\\nconvinced by the worldview of a Marx or Nietzsche (DePaul 1993: ch.\\n1).

While\\nRawls’ applications of reflective equilibrium assume that we\\nhave certain “convictions” (such as those opposing racial\\ndiscrimination or religious intolerance), in explaining the method he\\nis clear that “a person’s sense of justice may or may not\\nundergo a radical shift” (Rawls 1971: 49)—and on closer\\ninspection we see that convictions are only\\n“  fixed points” (Rawls 1971: 20; Rawls\\n2005: 8, emphasis added; see also Rawls 1974: 8).

In moral and political philosophy this is of\\ninterest mainly as a contrast with the   reflective\\nequilibrium endorsed by Rawls, Daniels, and many others in their wake\\n(but see Beisbart, Betz, & Brun 2021). A wide reflective\\nequilibrium is achieved where the deliberator has brought judgments\\nand principles into agreement having reflected on a wide range of\\nconsiderations. Wide reflective equilibrium contrasts with narrow\\nreflective equilibrium in several respects.  \\nnarrow  \\nwide  \\nFirst, we are not merely looking for principles that look like our\\ninitial judgments, giving our pre-theoretical opinions a philosophical\\nsheen. Rather,   should be\\nconsidered. Indeed, we should consider all principles to which our\\njudgments might plausibly conform, though “it is doubtful\\nwhether one can ever reach this state” (Rawls 1971: 49). We will\\nreturn to this contrast between the ideal and the practical.  \\na wide range of principles  \\nSecond, our initial judgments are   If you encounter\\na principle that seems to fit many of your most important judgments,\\nor even that does not fit them but has appeal nonetheless, you are\\nfree to change judgments that disagree with that principle. Perhaps a\\nprinciple even ranges over terrain on which you had no prior judgments\\n(e.g., moral dimensions of generative AI), in which case you can make\\nnew judgments that agree or disagree with it, as you see fit.\\nEverything is up for grabs. (Note that this second feature is\\nconsistent with giving initial judgments either no priority or weak\\npresumptive priority as discussed earlier.)  \\nrevisable.  \\nThird, we are to consider not just a very wide range of principles,\\nbut     for them. Ideally we\\nshould consider all such arguments (Rawls 1971: 49). We are also to\\nconsider arguments   principles. The arguments show the\\nstrengths and weaknesses of the principles under consideration\\n(Daniels 1996: 82). One important kind of argument is the thought\\nexperiment. For instance, in relation to the principle of utility, one\\nmight consider utilitarian sheriffs, utility monsters, experience\\nmachines, trolley problems, and repugnant conclusions, among countless\\nothers. A “directed reflective equilibrium” offers a\\nsequencing for consideration of such cases (Slavny et al. 2021). Note\\nthat such arguments may not only support one principle over another,\\nbut generate new principles, such as variant forms of\\nutilitarianism—and there will be new arguments for and against\\nthese variants, which generate their own variants, and so on.  \\na wide range of  \\narguments  \\nagainst  \\nFourth, as well as arguments, we should consider “devices of\\nrepresentation” (Rawls 2005: 23–28) or\\n“justificatory devices” (Daniels 1996: 59–60). It\\nmay be that we have greater confidence in certain conditions on the\\nselection of principles than we antecedently have in any particular\\nprinciples. Prominent examples of such justificatory devices are\\nRawls’ original position, other contemporary (Scanlon 1998) and\\nhistorical (Locke 1689; Rousseau 1762) contractualist devices, as well\\nas their contractarian (Hobbes 1651; Gauthier 1986) and ideal observer\\n(Hume 1740, book 3; Smith 1759) counterparts. Whether we find any such\\ndevice useful is a matter of whether it fits our judgments in wide\\nreflective equilibrium. If we do, we may have a powerful new argument\\nfor the principles that the device supports.  \\nFinally, moral and non-moral   can inform\\nour equilibrium. Arguments for and against principles referred to\\nabove are “inferences from relevant background theories”\\n(Daniels 1996: 82). Background theories can similarly be used to\\ninform our assessment of justificatory devices. For instance, our view\\nof Rawls’ contract device may be informed by our view of\\npersonal identity (Daniels 1996: 60). Indeed, Rawls  \\nbackground theories  \\nwent to great lengths to insure that the principles of justice did\\n‘fit’ with what we know about psychology, biology,\\nevolutionary theory, economics, and other social and natural sciences.\\n(Freeman 2007: 40)  \\nA wide reflective equilibrium achieves coherence not only between\\njudgments and principles regarding the issue at hand, but across the\\nfull breadth of the deliberator’s thought that might have\\nimplications for it.  \\nTo summarize, wide reflective equilibrium consists of agreement\\nbetween revisable judgments and principles following reflection on a\\nwide range of principles, arguments, justificatory devices, and\\nbackground theories. In its pure form, it is an impossibly demanding\\nmethod, drawing a vast and ever-growing expanse of principles,\\narguments and theories within its ambit. This exacting standard can\\nnevertheless inform our approach to a more modest reflective\\nequilibrium, as where Rawls compares his theory of justice’s\\n“principles and arguments with a few other familiar\\nviews,” which “moves us closer to the philosophical ideal;\\nit does not, of course, achieve it” (Rawls 1971: 49, 50; see\\nalso Rawls 2005: 97).'),\n",

For example, my principles of\\njustice may depend in part on my views of individual agency; and my\\nviews on agency may in turn depend on my views about free will and\\ncausation. But isn’t there a danger that this broad coherence is\\nbought at the cost of circularity?  \\nSuppose, for instance, that I have the conviction that no one should\\nbe very badly off. This judgment might support a sufficientarian\\nprinciple of justice requiring that no one is very badly off (e.g.,\\nFrankfurt 1987). But suppose I now claim that this principle is also\\nsupported by the combination of the luck egalitarian background theory\\nthat no one should be badly off through no genuine choice of their own\\n(Cohen 1989) with the hard determinist background theory that no one\\nis responsible for their choices, and my basis for the latter theory\\nis the original judgment no one should be very badly off.

Yet the\\nindependence constraint doesn’t allow judgments to be held back\\nin this way—if they support the principles they are necessarily\\nprinciple judgments and cannot be used as background judgments (Knight\\n2006: 211).  \\nOthers argue that the constraint is superfluous, as  \\n[a] person who explicitly cooked up all her relevant background\\nbeliefs on the basis of her considered moral judgments would not be\\nfollowing the method of reflective equilibrium in the first place.\\n(DePaul 1993: 15)  \\nBut perhaps the more serious problem the constraint addresses is not\\ndeliberate circularity.

Wide\\nreflective equilibrium is, furthermore, an exemplar of the broadly\\ncoherentist idea that beliefs can be justified by their coherence with\\na system of beliefs (Rawls 1974: 8; Daniels 1996: 60–61; Tersman\\n2008: 398–400). The deliberator is not expected to consider a\\nprinciple in isolation, but rather to consider its connections with\\nother principles as well as a wide range of moral and non-moral\\nbackground theories. A principle can be justified by its fit with a\\ncomprehensive system of thought exhibiting logical, probabilistic, and\\nexplanatory relations among its members (Brink 1989: 103). For\\nexample, and as we have seen, Rawls’ theory of justice justifies\\nits principles of justice by appeal to theories of the person and of\\nmorality, among other background theories. Coherentists claim that\\nmoral beliefs alone are not enough for reflective equilibrium; they\\nrely on theory-grounded second-order beliefs about the reliability of\\nfirst order beliefs (Brink 1989: 127; Tersman 2008: 399).'),\n",

This may, however, seem to put reflective\\nequilibrium in Baier’s sights, and in danger of solipsism; this\\nconcern is addressed below in the discussion of public reflective\\nequilibrium.  \\nWhile reflective equilibrium is not committed to devices of\\njustification, it is usually understood as being committed to\\nprinciples. Rawls and Daniels understand an equilibrium as between\\njudgments and principles, so if there are no principles, there can be\\nno equilibrium. This could, nevertheless, be seen as an arbitrary\\nrestriction on moral deliberation.

On one view the core of reflective equilibrium is\\ninspired by Socrates’ transformation of his pupils’\\n“inarticulate hunches into fully explicit beliefs”\\n(Schroeter 2004: 121). This “maieutic reflection” makes\\nour inchoate moral notions more precise; sometimes we will endorse\\nthem, but at other times we may find they conflict and revise some of\\nthem. Maieutic reflection is a valuable tool of moral enquiry even if\\nthere is no “stable resting point” and no intention to\\nbuild a moral theory (Schroeter 2004: 122). Even antitheorists could\\nuse this method. An apparent qualification is that\\nconstructivists—those that hold that “moral facts are\\nepistemically constrained” (Schroeter 2004: 111)—are\\ncommitted to moral theory after all.  \\nCuriously, the index of Rawls’  \\nprovides a concise statement of a principle-less method:\\n“Reflective equilibrium: defined as when judgments at all levels\\nof generality are in line on due reflection” (Rawls 2005: 514).\\nRather than bringing principles and judgments into agreement, as per\\nRawls’ official position, this variant would only bring\\njudgments into agreement with each other. This would still allow us to\\nretain major justificatory elements of wide reflective equilibrium,\\narriving at a coherent set of considered judgments revised in light of\\na wide range of competing principles, arguments, and background\\ntheories. The only difference is that our judgments are not\\nnecessarily represented in principles. Deliberators are free to follow\\nthe classic mutual adjustment of principles and judgments should they\\nwish, but the output that is measured is judgments alone, “at\\nall levels of generality”: utilitarians’ one big judgment,\\nanti-theorists’ countless smaller ones, and every position in\\nbetween.  \\nPolitical Liberalism'),\n",

It\\nmight nevertheless be urged that, if our views are to have some impact\\nin the real world, they should move other people as well as ourselves\\n(Anderson 2015). This is a challenge to reflective equilibrium from\\npolitical practice rather than moral epistemology, and philosophers\\nmay feel it is not their role to address it—it is enough for\\nthem to set out justified views. Still, those with policy ambitions\\nfor reflective equilibrium have described three broad forms of  \\npublic reflective equilibrium.  \\nThe first keeps individualist reflective equilibrium as its starting\\npoint, but aims to achieve convergence between equilibria (Daniels\\n1996: 33–39). The later Rawls particularly appeals to the idea\\nof an “overlapping consensus” (Rawls 2005). The broad\\nmotivation here is that in a plural society with a diversity of\\ncomprehensive moral doctrines we cannot rely on any one comprehensive\\ndoctrine, such as utilitarianism, Kantianism, or a specific religious\\nfaith, to support our political principles. Rather, the reflective\\nequilibria of adherents of each of these comprehensive doctrines can\\nconverge on a specific set of liberal principles, each for different\\nreasons. The later Rawls continues to assume that reflective\\nequilibria are wide, but now maintains that they should be\\n  “the same conception is affirmed in\\neveryone’s considered judgments” (Rawls 2005: 384 n. 16).\\nHe refers to wide and general reflective equilibrium as  \\ngeneral:  \\nfull\\nreflective equilibrium.  \\nAn alternative form of public reflective equilibrium appears to reject\\nindividualism even as a starting point, drawing on empirical work to\\nform judgments and principles. One version of this approach is\\nquantitative, drawing on survey data (Savulescu et al. 2021). Another\\nversion is qualitative, using interviews or “semi-structured\\ndiscussions” (Wolff & de Shalit 2007: 11). For instance, in\\na study on social disadvantage, the researchers  \\nconsulted our interviewees about our views and we learnt from them. In\\nthis process we revised and modified our theory according to the\\ntheories and intuitions expressed by the interviewees. (Wolff & de\\nShalit 2007: 12)  \\nThe specific topic might make particular interviewees\\nappropriate—in the disadvantage case, those that provide\\nservices to the disadvantaged as well as disadvantaged people\\nthemselves—or more informal selection methods may be used:  \\nIf possible, the decision with whom to talk should be done by\\nstrolling in different parts of the city, bumping into people every\\nnow and then, and asking them to enter into a discussion. (de Shalit\\n2020: 19)  \\nA difficulty with this approach is that it may be too ambitious in its\\nexpectations of the general public’s theorizing, as it takes not\\nonly judgments but theories from consultees. Yet the general public\\nmay not have moral and political principles, if they do have such\\nprinciples they may conflict, and their views certainly do not mirror\\ntheoretical divides in philosophy (e.g., between Kantians and\\nutilitarians) (Baderin 2017: 11–12).  \\nThis may motivate a final form of public reflective equilibrium, which\\nuses the public’s judgments but not their theories, and in\\nparticular their case-specific judgments (Baderin 2017; see also\\nMiller 1999). The merit of using the public’s judgments is that\\nthey are  , which might be considered\\nan essential requirement if a meaningful balance is to be struck\\nbetween judgments and principles, but one which can hardly be met by\\nphilosophers’ judgments (Baderin 2017: 15–19).

Consider the coherentist interpretation of reflective\\nequilibrium discussed above, which highlights that judgments and\\nprinciples in equilibrium cohere with the deliberator’s entire\\nsystem of thought, which has arisen from reflection on all relevant\\nprinciples and argument.

The\\njudgments of participants in reflective equilibrium might be\\nconsidered unreliable in the sense that they vary with factors that\\nthey themselves consider irrelevant (Paulo 2020: 335–336).  \\nAdditional biases are suggested by experiments bringing out the\\nemotional nature of moral reasoning.

Peter Singer suggests that considered\\njudgments in such cases are emotionally-driven evolved responses to\\ncircumstances that no longer obtain:  \\nthe salient feature that explains our different intuitive judgments\\nconcerning the two cases is that the footbridge case is the kind of\\nsituation that was likely to arise during the eons of time over which\\nwe were evolving; whereas the standard trolley case describes a way of\\nbringing about someone’s death that has only been possible in\\nthe past century or two, a time far too short to have any impact on\\nour inherited patterns of emotional response.
