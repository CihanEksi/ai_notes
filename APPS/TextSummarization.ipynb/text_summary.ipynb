      "Facebook's CEO Mark Zuckerberg spoke at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, expressing sympathy for Apple's stance on refusing to help the FBI break into an iPhone belonging to a terrorist. While acknowledging the importance of preventing terrorism, Zuckerberg emphasized Facebook's responsibility to protect its users' privacy and security. He stated that Facebook will take opportunities to work with governments to prevent attacks, but will not compromise its users' privacy.

Tim Cook has warned that complying with the order would set a dangerous precedent and put sensitive data at risk. Other tech companies, including Huawei, have sided with Apple, citing the importance of consumer privacy and security. The companies are concerned that if encryption can be broken, it will inevitably be leaked and imperil security for personal and business information.

      "Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg has expressed sympathy with Apple CEO Tim Cook's stance against the US government's request to break into the iPhone of a mass shooter. Zuckerberg emphasized that requiring backdoors to encryption is not a viable solution, citing the need for balance between national security and individual privacy. He also acknowledged the company's responsibility to help prevent terrorism and attacks, and expressed willingness to work with the government on investigations. Facebook's stance is consistent with its previous statement supporting Apple's refusal to comply with the FBI's request, which it argues would undermine privacy and security. Other major tech firms, including Huawei, have also sided with Apple, with Richard Yu, consumer devices chief for Huawei, stating that privacy is \"the most important thing to the consumer.\" The tech industry is concerned that compromising encryption would set a dangerous precedent, allowing governments and even criminals to access sensitive data, and imperiling security for personal and business information.\n",
